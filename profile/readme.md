We foster the early development of the child, starting with reading, through a set of fun and science-backed cards. 🌱
 The Montessori Materials are designed to be self-teaching and self-correcting. It is almost as if they call out to you to use them in the appropriate way, use them in the way that teaches the intended lesson. The materials are the teacher in the classroom, not the adult.
